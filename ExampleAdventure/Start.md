# Exciting Example Adventure!

![Blue Door on Wikimedia][MainImage]

This is a *thrilling* sample adventure to demonstrate the Markdown
formatting used by DHTML Adventure.

You are standing in the "Room" encoded by the "Start.md" file. A
"Room" does not have to be a room - it could be a forest, halfway up a
ladder, the moment when the king realizes you've eaten his last gum
drop, a conversation with an alien; Anything! It is a place where you
learn something about the story, maybe have some choices to make, or
possibly win or lose the adventure!

All rooms are written in [Markdown][mdLink], and should end with
".md". Markdown may be confusing at first glance, but it is very
simple and quick to write once you know some basics. This adventure
will help teach you how to write markdown, and how to write it
specifically so it can form your own adventure!

The Start room ("Start.md") should be included in all adventures, as
that file name triggers a recognition by the code that it represents
the beginning of an adventure.

Why don't we [step inside](Hallway.md) and continue the tutorial?
