# Finding images to use in your adventure

![Koogan Binoculars on Wikipedia][Binoculars]

You can [make your own images](CreatingImages.md), but there are a
huge number of images, for all kinds of subjects, already on the
internet. All the major image formats (jpg, png, gif, others) can be
displayed in DHTML Adventure.

Before you begin your search for interesting pictures, please bear in
mind that the *majority* of images on the internet are **not**
"free" - they're generally protected by copyright. In fact, if a
website does not say one way or the other, you need to assume that the
image is copyrighted and the creator does not want you to download a
copy.

However, that does not mean that there aren't many freely usable
images out there. Google makes it easy to find images where the owner
has licensed them as [CreativeCommons][CC], allowing them to be copied
freely. Google Images has a feature to show only such images, here are
some example searches:

* [Google image search for freely usable "puppy" images][PuppySearch] -
  The search setting here is "Labeled for reuse", which means the
  person who put the image on the web has specifically noted that the
  image may be used by other people.
* [Google image search for "castle" on WikiMedia][CastleSearch] - Wikimedia
  is where Wikipedia keeps its images. All images on wikipedia are
  licensed for open usage.
* [Google images, animated "machine"][AnimatedSearch] - The "Search
  Tools" section can let you search for animated images as
  well. Wikipedia contains some pretty neat moving diagrams.

You can use those links to help set up searches, and then just change
"puppy" or "castle" to the kind of picture you want to search for.

Again, when you use an image from the internet, be sure to make note
of the original page you found it on, and the creator's name, if you
can find it.

You can [return to the images page](Images.md), or
[go back to the hallway](AboutMarkdown.md)
