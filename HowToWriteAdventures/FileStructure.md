# File Structure

Your adventure should be stored completely in its own folder. For
example, this tutorial is inside `HowToWriteAdventures`. That folder
should be inside the same folder that holds the "game engine"
(`index.html` and the code folder `assets`).

You can optionally have a special file called `AdventureList.md` at
the same level as `index.html`. That file is a welcome page that you
can use to present your adventure(s) to the player.

The only file that is required is the `Start.md` file - It is the room
the player will begin in.
