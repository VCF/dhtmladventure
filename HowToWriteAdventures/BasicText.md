# Basic Text Formatting

![Moveable Type on Wikimedia][MainImage]

Plain text is, well, plain text. Just write what you want and it will
appear unformatted, like this. You can write all as one long line, or
you can put the text on multiple lines.

Include a blank line (no text or spaces) to start a new paragraph. For
example:

- - - - - - - -

This is one paragraph.
Here is part of the first paragraph, though it is on its own line.

This is a new paragraph.
And this is part of that new paragraph, too.

- - - - - - - -

A "horizontal rule" (a line across the page) is just three or more
dashes in a row. You can put spaces between the dashes if you'd like.

Text *can be italic* by putting it between single asterisks, and
**bold text** uses two asterisks.

If you really need your text to appear precisely as you type it, you
can use a "code block", which is specified by starting each line with
four extra spaces.
