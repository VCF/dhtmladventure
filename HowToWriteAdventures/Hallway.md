# Basic Text Formatting

![Eastern State Penitentiary on Wikimedia][MainImage]

Plain text is, well, plain text. Just write what you want and it will
appear unformatted. You can write all as one long line, or you can put
the text on multiple lines.

Include a blank line (no text or spaces) to start a new paragraph. For
example, If I write

    This is one paragraph.
    Here is part of the first paragraph, though it is on its own line.

    This is a new paragraph.
    And this is part of that new paragraph, too.

I get:

This is one paragraph.
Here is part of the first paragraph, though it is on its own line.

This is a new paragraph.
And this is part of that new paragraph, too.

Text *can be italic* by putting it between single asterisks, and
**bold text** uses two asterisks.

    Text *can be italic* by putting it between single asterisks, and
    **bold text** uses two asterisks:

"Code blocks" can be written by indenting all lines by 4 spaces (that
is, putting 4 spaces at the front of each line).

You can now [return to the start](Start.md), or [continue on to adding images](EmptyRoom.md).
