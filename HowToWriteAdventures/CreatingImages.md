# Creating your own images

![Pierre Subleyras on Wikimedia][MainImage]

Making your own pictures to go with your story will put an extra
personal touch on your adventure. There are several options available
to you for creating your own images.

1. Digital camera (cell phone, point 'n' shoot, etc)
2. "Traditional" art work (pencil, crayon, paint, etc) then
   [scanning][Scanner]
3. Using [graphics software][imageSoftware] to make the picture
   directly on the compture.

The advantage of the last option is that you do not need any
additional hardware (a camera or scanner). Furthermore, there are some
excellent free graphics programs available for all major computer
platforms:

* **Raster Graphics** aka "pixel painting" - These programs let you
  paint down to the individual pixel if you want
  * [GIMP][gimp] ([Wikipedia][gimpWP]) - Very advanced image editor
    with many features normally found in expensive commercial
    software. The user interface can be irritating.
  * [Tux Paint][tux] ([Wikipedia][tuxWP]) - A *very simple* drawing
    program, primarily aimed at young children. It can be used to
    quickly make simple scenes.
* **Vector Graphics** - Draw graphics with shapes. Normally used to
  make high resolution diagrams, but can also export the pictures to
  PNG (which you will **need** to do for the images to be displayed in
  DHTML Adventure)
  * [Inkscape][ink] ([Wikipedia][inkWP]) - A professional-grade vector
    editor designed to make advanced SVG images. May be too complex
    for beginners.
  * [Libre Office][LO] ([Wikipedia][LOWP]) - This is actually a
    full-featured "Office Suite", including a word processor,
    presentation, drawing and spreadsheet applications. The "Draw"
    program can be used to easily make shape-based pictures.

You can also consider [finding images online](FindingImages.md), or
you can return to the [image basics page](Images.md) or the
[Markdown hallway](AboutMarkdown.md).
