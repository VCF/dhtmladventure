# Markdown File Format

![Eastern State Penitentiary on Wikimedia][MainImage]

The room files in DHTML Adventure are written in a simple file format
called [Markdown][mdLink], and should end with ".md". Markdown may be
confusing at first glance, but it is very simple and quick to write
once you know some basics. This adventure will help teach you how to
write markdown, and how to write it specifically so it can form your
own adventure!

To help you, there is a **little gear icon in the top left corner**,
it looks like this: ![Options Menu](../assets/images/Gear20x20.png)

That let's you access a menu of options, including **Show Page
Source**. For every room you enter, that option will show you the
exact Markdown file used to make that room. You are encouraged to
compare that source to what you see to help understand how to build
room files.

I will also try to include comments in the source. Comments look like
this `[//]: # (This is an example of a comment)`, but won't be shown
in the game; They are there to help explain the markdown code

[//]: # (This is an example of a comment)
[//]: # (Comment code taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/20885980 )
You can now visit:
