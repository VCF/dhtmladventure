# Make your own adventures!

![Blue Door on Wikimedia][MainImage]

This is a sample adventure to demonstrate how you can use the DHTML
Adventure system to write your own adventures.

You are standing in the "Room" encoded by the "Start.md" file. A
"Room" does not have to actually be a room - it could be a forest,
halfway up a ladder, the moment when the king realizes you've eaten
his last gum drop, a conversation with an alien; Anything! It is a
place where you learn something about the story, maybe have some
choices to make, or possibly win or lose the adventure!

Why don't we [step inside](AboutMarkdown.md) and begin the tutorial?
