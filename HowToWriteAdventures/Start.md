# Make your own adventures!

![Blue Door on Wikimedia][MainImage]

This is a sample adventure to demonstrate how you can use the DHTML
Adventure system to write your own adventures.

You are standing in the "Room" encoded by the "Start.md" file. A
"Room" does not have to actually be a room - it could be a forest,
halfway up a ladder, the moment when the king realizes you've eaten
his last gum drop, a conversation with an alien; Anything! It is a
place where you learn something about the story, maybe have some
choices to make, or possibly win or lose the adventure!

All rooms are written in a simple file format called
[Markdown][mdLink], and should end with ".md". Markdown may be
confusing at first glance, but it is very simple and quick to write
once you know some basics. This adventure will help teach you how to
write markdown, and how to write it specifically so it can form your
own adventure!

The Start room ("Start.md") should be included in all adventures, as
that file name triggers a recognition by the code that it represents
the beginning of an adventure.

Why don't we [step inside](Hallway.md) and continue the tutorial?
